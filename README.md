# Encrypting docs in the current directory
# arquivo.txt and arquivo2.txt are exemple files to test the encrypt.
# if you run encrypt.py all the files in the current directory will be encrypted and generate a key
# you can decrypt running decrypt.py when thekey.key is in the current directory

# if you double encrypt the files, the current key will be replaced by the second encryption key AND YOU WILL LOST YOUR FILES FOREVER!
# if you want do double encrypt, make sure you save the first key in another place
# do not use this code for malicious purposes, and be careful.
